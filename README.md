# Tic-tac-toe-AI
This is a collaborative python project between @sinamandla1 and @Mat-t-hew to create a TicTacToe game featuring an AI element.

The game is very simple. Automatically the CPU and Human player are assigned 'O' and 'X' respectively, then the player chooses
any number ranging from 0 to 8. The CPU will actively attempt to block the player from winning. The game could be made impossible
using Minmax algorithm, but we kept it simlpe so more decisive results occur.
